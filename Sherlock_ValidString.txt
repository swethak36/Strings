A "valid" string is a string SS such that for all distinct characters in SS each such character occurs the same number of times in SS.

For example, aabb is a valid string because the frequency of both characters a and b is 22, whereas aabbc is not a valid string 
because the frequency of characters a, b, and c is not the same. 
Watson gives a string SS to Sherlock and asks him to remove some characters from the string such that the new string is a "valid" string. 
Sherlock wants to know from you if it's possible to be done with less than or equal to one removal.
